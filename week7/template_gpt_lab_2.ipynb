        "\n",
        "If you’ve been online lately, you’ve likely seen the excitement about OpenAI’s newest language model, ChatGPT. ChatGPT is astonishingly good at many things, including debugging code and rewriting text in whatever style you ask it. As an offshoot of GPT-3.5, a large language model (LLM) with billions of parameters, ChatGPT owes its impressive knowledge to the fact that it’s seen a large portion of the internet during training — in the form of the Common Crawl corpus and other data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chatbots are understandable that people are excited by a language model that can hold a conversation and create a solid semblance of intelligence. But we need to stay critical when it comes to the validity of answers generated by these models. LLMs especially are prone to hallucinations: producing text that sounds sensible at first but doesn’t hold up to closer scrutiny and presenting things as facts that are made up entirely.\n",
        "Semantic search engines — our specialty at deepset — are often powered by extractive question-answering models. These models return verbatim snippets from the knowledge base rather than generating text from scratch the way ChatGPT does.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Haystack](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/intro), deepset’s open-source framework for applied natural language processing (NLP), allows you to leverage multiple GPT models in your pipeline. With this approach, you can build a GPT-powered semantic search engine that uses your data as ground truth and bases its natural-language answers on the information it contains. Besides providing a comfortable entry point to the OpenAI API, Haystack offers all the other components you need to successfully implement an end-to-end NLP system with GPT: a vector database, a module for retrieval, and the pipeline that combines all those elements into one queryable system."

        "From observation, we can say that GPT is exceptionally good at understanding implication and intent. It can remember what’s been discussed earlier in the conversation, including figuring out what you’re referring to with words like “he” or “before that,” It can tell you when your question doesn’t make sense. All of these properties account for the increased importance of actual intelligence. It also has to generate language from scratch, a much more challenging task than returning the correct section from a corpus."
